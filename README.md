# Double-hashing-table
In this project, I design and implement a hash table data structure. A hash table is a data structure where values are mapped to a position in a table using a hash function. For this project, I implement a double hash table in which collisions are resolved using double hashing. I use hash functions sufficiently even so as to allow all expected constant-time operations to be O(1).


Made as project for the ECE 250 course taken at the University of Waterloo. (ECE 2A- Fall 2017)

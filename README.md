# Double-hashing-table
In this project, you design and implement a hash table data structure. A hash table is a data structure where values are mapped to a position in a table using a hash function. For this project, you will implement a double hash table in which collisions are resolved using double hashing. We will use hash functions sufficiently even so as to allow all expected constant-time operations to be O(1).
